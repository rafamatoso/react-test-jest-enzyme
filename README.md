## Course Overview

Take your React code to the next level by learning Test Driven Development (TDD) with Jest and Enzyme! Jest is a powerful, flexible testing framework, and Enzyme provides tools to test React and Redux applications. In this course, you will learn to test:

- Connected and unconnected components
- Component state and Redux state
- Action creators and reducers
- Complex action creators that use Redux Thunk and Axios
- Action creators called from connected components
- React hooks, including useEffect, useState and useReducer
- React context, including context with embedded state
- Using Jest mock functions to spy on methods, control their return values or simply prevent them from running during the test
